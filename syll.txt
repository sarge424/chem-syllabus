Isoelectric point.
Classification of proteins on the basis of
molecular shape; primary, secondary, tertiary
and quaternary, structures of proteins,
denaturation of proteins. (Definitions only.
Details and diagrams are not required). Vitamins - Classification and functions.
Vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K: classification
(fat soluble and water soluble), deficiency
diseases. (Chemical names and structures are not
required).
Nucleic Acids - DNA and RNA.
Nucleic acids: basic unit – purine and
pyrimidine, DNA – structure (double helical),
RNA (No chemical structure required).
Differences between DNA and RNA.
15. Polymers
Definition and classification on different
parameters. Methods of polymerisation
(addition and condensation), copolymerisation,
and some important polymers: natural and
synthetic like polythene, nylon polyesters,
bakelite, rubber. Biodegradable and non- biodegradable polymers.
Classification based on source, on structure, on
mode of polymerisation, on molecular forces, on
growth (with free radical mechanism).
Preparation of important addition polymers - Polythene, polypropene, PVC, PTFE,
polystyrene.
Rubber – natural and synthetic (Buna-N and
Buna-S), vulcanisation of rubber.
Preparation of important condensation polymers
- polyester, Nylon 66, Nylon 6, Bakelite,
melamine (to be learnt in terms of monomers and
equations).
Biodegradable polymers – PHBV, Nylon 2 - Nylon 6.
Uses.
