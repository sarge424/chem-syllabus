as a cell) may be electrical, mechanical,
thermal or radiant energy. The emf of a
source is defined as the work done per unit
charge to force them to go to the higher
point of potential (from -ve terminal to +ve
terminal inside the cell) so,  = dW /dq; but
dq = Idt; dW = dq = Idt . Equating total

external resistor R plus the work done
across the internal resistance r; Idt=I2R dt

(d) Statement and explanation of Kirchhoff's
laws with simple examples. The first is a
conservation law for charge and the 2nd is
law of conservation of energy. Note change
in potential across a resistor V=IR<0
when we go ‘down’ with the current
(compare with flow of water down a river),
and V=IR>0 if we go up against the
current across the resistor. When we go
through a cell, the -ve terminal is at a
lower level and the +ve terminal at a
higher level, so going from -ve to +ve
through the cell, we are going up and
V=+ and going from +ve to -ve terminal
through the cell, we are going down, so V = -. Application to simple circuits.

BH,  and  - their definitions and
relations.
(e) Properties of diamagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
substances; their susceptibility and
relative permeability. It is better to explain the main
distinction, the cause of magnetization
(M) is due to magnetic dipole moment
(m) of atoms, ions or molecules being 0
for dia, >0 but very small for para and
> 0 and large for ferromagnetic
materials; few examples; placed in
external B

, very small (induced)
magnetization in a direction opposite
to B

in dia, small magnetization
parallel to B

for para, and large
magnetization parallel to B

for
ferromagnetic materials; this leads to
lines of B

becoming less dense, more
dense and much more dense in dia,
para and ferro, respectively; hence, a
weak repulsion for dia, weak attraction
for para and strong attraction for ferro
magnetic material. Also, a small bar
suspended in the horizontal plane
becomes perpendicular to the B

field
for dia and parallel to B

for para and
ferro. Defining equation H = (B/0)-M;
the magnetic properties, susceptibility
m = (M/H) < 0 for dia (as M is
opposite H) and >0 for para, both very
small, but very large for ferro; hence
relative permeability r =(1+ m) < 1
for dia, > 1 for para and >>1 (very
large) for ferro; further, m1/T
(Curie’s law) for para, independent of
temperature (T) for dia and depends
on T in a complicated manner for
ferro; on heating ferro becomes para
at Curie temperature. Electromagnet:

hence draw phase diagram, combine

7. Dual Nature of Radiation andMatter

Hertz and Lenard's observations; Einstein's
photoelectric equation - particle nature of
light. Matter waves - wave nature of particles,
de-Broglie relation; conclusion from
Davisson-Germer experiment. X-rays.
(a) Photo electric effect, quantization of
radiation; Einstein's equation
Emax = h - W0; threshold frequency; work
function; experimental facts of Hertz and
Lenard and their conclusions; Einstein
used Planck’s ideas and extended it to
apply for radiation (light); photoelectric
effect can be explained only assuming
quantum (particle) nature of
radiation. Determination of Planck’s
constant (from the graph of stopping
potential Vs versus frequency f of the
incident light). Momentum of photon
p=E/c=h/c=h/.
(b) De Broglie hypothesis, phenomenon of
electron diffraction (qualitative only).
Wave nature of radiation is exhibited in
interference, diffraction and polarisation;
particle nature is exhibited in photoelectric
effect. Dual nature of matter: particle
nature common in that it possesses
momentum p and kinetic energy KE. The
wave nature of matter was
proposed by Louis de Broglie,
=h/p= h/mv. Davisson and Germer
experiment; qualitative description of the
experiment and conclusion. (c) A simple modern X-ray tube (Coolidge
tube) – main parts: hot cathode, heavy
element anode (target) kept cool, all
enclosed in a vacuum tube; elementary
theory of X-ray production; effect of
increasing filament current- temperature
increases rate of emission of electrons
(from the cathode), rate of production of X
rays and hence, intensity of X rays
increases (not its frequency); increase in
anode potential increases energy of each
electron, each X-ray photon and hence, X- ray frequency (E=h); maximum frequency
hmax =eV; continuous spectrum of X rays
has minimum wavelength min=
c/max=hc/eV. Moseley’s law.
Characteristic and continuous X rays, their
origin.(This topic is not to be evaluated)
